# Simple documentation of Kotlin rules and syntax

## Variables

We can create variables in Kotlin by using the __var__ or __val__ keywords. Simply say _var nameOfVar : valueDesired_ and the same thought applies to __val__ 
One such example is _var name : "Bob"_. Here we created a variable called name that stores the String Bob. Now there are some differences between _val_ and _var_.
_var_ is mutable while _val_ is not. This means that _var_ can be reassigned multiple times while _val_ is static/constant and can only be assigned once.
__val__ is equivalent to the __final__ keyword in java.

## Data Types



## Classes

Similar to java, Kotlin classes use the __class__ to delcare the creation of a new class. The format is usually _class NameOfClass {/* code class goes here */}_
To use that class to create objects use then follow the same procedure as making a variable. It should look something like this __var nameOfObj : Object()__ where Object() is the class you want to make 
an instance of.
